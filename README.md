## Getting Started

The fastest way: hand this repo to an AI agent.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) toolchain
- Tauri CLI [system dependencies](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) (varies by OS)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Output artifacts are in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Usage

**Drag & Drop**: Drag any `.md` file onto the md2u window.

**Command Line**:

```bash
md2u /path/to/yourfile.md
```

The preview updates automatically when the file is saved — no manual refresh needed.

## Security

All release installers are compiled from source by GitHub Actions and scanned before publishing:

- **Linux** (`.deb`, `.rpm`) — Built on GitHub Ubuntu runner, scanned with [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/)
- **Windows** (`.exe`, `.msi`) — Built on GitHub Windows runner, scanned with Windows Defender

If any scan fails, the release is not published. View the full build log for each release on the [Actions](../../actions) page.

### FAQ

**Q: The binaries are already built from source — why scan for malware?**

Scanning at the artifact output stage detects known malicious signatures in the final binary, serving as the last layer of defense-in-depth. It complements dependency auditing, pinned package versions, and isolated build environments to cover the full supply chain threat surface.

**Q: Why not use VirusTotal?**

The free VirusTotal API is limited to 1 request per day — not enough for CI/CD (each release scans 4 files). This project uses platform-native alternatives instead: ClamAV on Linux and Windows Defender on Windows.

**Q: My antivirus flagged the installer — is it safe?**

This app is not yet code-signed. Some heuristic scanners may flag unsigned open-source binaries as suspicious. We are currently applying for code signing through [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) — thank SignPath Foundation for supporting open source projects like ours. Windows Defender and ClamAV both pass. Source code is fully public — verify it yourself or build from source.

**Q: Why no macOS (.dmg)?**

macOS requires installers to be signed and notarized by an Apple Developer account. Unsigned `.dmg` files are blocked by Gatekeeper on macOS 13+. This project does not yet have an Apple Developer certificate ($99/year). A macOS build will be added once funding is available.
